# Milestone 2

## Description
Describe what you did for this milestone in your own words.
What we did in this milestone is that we basically took everything we learned in this class and put it all together. We successfully finished creating a Space Invaders-type
game with our own unique characters and projectiles.
## Challenges encountered
Describe the challenges you encountered while working on this milestone of the project.
A big challenge I faced was that my opponent and opponent projectile were actually growing in size when I ran the game, but eventually I was able to fix this issue.  
## Things I've learned
What is the most important thing you've learned from this milestone in the project?
The most important thing I learned from this milestone is just how to put all the pieces together. There was so many aspects of our course involved in this milestone,
and I feel like using all of that to create a simple video game was very important.
